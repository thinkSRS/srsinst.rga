Custom tasks
=================

The RGA application is the srsgui application running with the configuration
in the .taskconfig file in the srsinst.rga package.

By opening a different .taskconfig file from the main menu File/Open, you can run
with a different configuration containing a different set of instruments and tasks.

When you create a new configuration, refer to the `Creating a project <create_project_>`_
section and `Writing a task section <create_task_>`_ section in the srsgui_ documentation
for details.
